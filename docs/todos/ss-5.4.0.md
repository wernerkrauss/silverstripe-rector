# Silverstripe 5.4.0 Rector TODOs

Original Changelog: [docs.silverstripe.org](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/5/changelogs/5.4.0/#api-changes)

- [ ] This change ensures CMS 5 can continue to be installed in scenarios where Composer is installed with Symfony 7. This can be done manually, and is also likely to be a future default.
- [ ] The likelihood of someone subclassing the relevant classes is very low.
- [ ] For installations of installer with earlier versions of Symfony this won't cause any problems, since PHP allows return types to be more specific in subclasses. This is known as covariance.
